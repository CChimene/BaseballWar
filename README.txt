This is Baseball W.A.R. a card game I'm working on implementing in Unity. Currently only the tutorial is fully implemented. 
6/23/19: The 9 inning game should work now but extra innings is not yet implemented.

Design Notes
The name is a play on WAR, which is a baseball stat (Wins above replacement) and the card game War, which I got some mechanical inspiration from. The main goal is to test out a card game where both players have pretty good or even complete knoweldge of their opponent's hand and how that influences decision making.


TODO

-Extra Innings
-Card color changing option
