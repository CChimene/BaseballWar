This is Baseball W.A.R. a card game I'm working on implementing in Unity. Currently only the tutorial is fully implemented. 


Design Notes
The name is a play on WAR, which is a baseball stat (Wins above replacement) and the card game War, which I got some mechanical inspiration from. The main goal is to test out a card game where both players have pretty good or even complete knoweldge of their opponent's hand and how that influences decision making.
